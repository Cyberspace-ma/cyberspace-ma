## Introduction

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity challenges where participants solve a variety of tasks to find hidden "flags." These flags are usually strings of text that prove you've solved the challenge. CTFs are a great way to learn and practice real-world cybersecurity skills in a controlled environment.

This repository contains a collection of challenges, write-ups, tools, and resources to help you prepare for CTF competitions. The challenges are categorized by difficulty and type, so you can start with the basics and work your way up to more advanced topics.

## Categories

CTF challenges are typically divided into several categories. Below is a brief overview of each category:

### 1. **Reverse Engineering**
   - Analyze and reverse engineer compiled binaries to understand their functionality and find hidden flags.
   - Common Tools: Ghidra, IDA Pro, Radare2.

### 2. **Cryptography**
   - Solve challenges related to encryption, decryption, and cryptographic algorithms.
   - Common Tools: OpenSSL, John the Ripper, Hashcat.

### 3. **Web Exploitation**
   - Exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access or retrieve flags.
   - Common Tools: Burp Suite, SQLmap, Dirb.

### 4. **Binary Exploitation**
   - Exploit vulnerabilities in binary programs to gain control over their execution flow.
   - Common Tools: GDB, Pwntools, ROPgadget.

### 5. **Forensics**
   - Analyze digital artifacts such as memory dumps, network traffic, and file systems to uncover hidden flags.
   - Common Tools: Volatility, Wireshark, Binwalk.

### 6. **Miscellaneous**
   - Challenges that don't fit into the above categories, often requiring creative thinking and problem-solving skills.
